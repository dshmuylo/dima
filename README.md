1. Save Battery by Turning off the Display and/or EVF
Worried about saving battery power while you’re out on a long shoot? Here is a trick to get the display to shut off completely when you are actively using the EVF, and how to keep both dark when neither is in use. This requires delving into the Custom Key Settings located near the end of the Gear menus. In there, you can change nearly any of your buttons to handle another task, and is well worth the time to explore and program. The setting we are going to use is Finder/Monitor Sel.—NOT the Deactivate Monitor setting, as this keeps the screen lit, though it removes all images from the display. Next, you should go to the FINDER/MONITOR selection earlier in the Gear menus. Here, all you have to do is select either Monitor (Manual) or Viewfinder (Manual) and you are all set. This does prevent automatic switching, but I prefer it—when I have the camera by my side and set to EVF, ready to go, the EVF and screen are both off and the EVF will only be activated when I raise the camera to my eye. This will save a substantial amount of power.
